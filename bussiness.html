                Business Correspondent (BC) Point application for a banking system serves as a vital tool to bridge the gap between traditional banking services and underserved communities, especially in rural and remote areas. 
                 This application empowers mediators, who are not formal bank employees, to provide essential banking services such as cash withdrawals, deposits, account creation, and policy applications.
                 It streamlines processes by enabling users to access banking policies like insurance and schemes, initiate loan processes, and schedule appointments with local bank managers, all through a single platform.</p><br>
                 <p>   Additionally, the application facilitates financial inclusion by allowing users to open zero-balance accounts and perform basic transactions with ease.
                      By offering an efficient, user-friendly interface and seamless integration with banking systems, the BC Point application enhances accessibility, reduces dependency on physical bank branches, and promotes digital literacy among users, ultimately fostering economic growth and social empowerment.
